# Predicting-income-in-R
This is a final project for Data Analysis & Visualization (INFX 512) class that I have taken in Spring semester of 2020 at University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The census data extracted from the 1994 and 1995 Current Population Surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau were analyzed. It was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The feature selection and extraction approaches were performed for the predictive analysis. The classification techniques were applied to predict whether an individual makes over $50K a year. K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed on the dataset of continuous variables.
